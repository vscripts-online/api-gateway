## classToSwaggerJson

It takes class as a parameter and creates a serializable object according to the example value in that @ApiProperty decorator.

```ts
class AccountSyncSizeResponseDTO {
  @ApiProperty({ example: 16106127360 })
  storage_size: number;

  @ApiProperty({ example: 16106127360 })
  available_size: number;
}
```

To

```ts
{ storage_size: 16106127360, available_size: 16106127360 }
```

## Actions taken in case of forgot_password request

When the user requests forgot_password, a 6-digit code consisting only of numbers is generated. It records the code creation time and the sent code in the user data in the database.

If more than 3 forgot_password requests are sent within 24 hours, too many request exceptions will be thrown.

If the code is created a second time within 1 minute, it returns true without doing anything. This means that the e-mail has been sent, but since it was already sent 1 minute ago, it does not send it again and does not make any changes to the user data.

If the last e-mail sending was done within 1 minute to 5 minutes, it saves the time of code creation in the user data and sends the code again without changing the code.

## Ubuntu server configuration

Since ufw blocks docker communication, containers cannot communicate with each other. That's why [ufw-docker](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker) should be used.

Update the relevant file [here](https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#solving-ufw-and-docker-issues).

You do not need to do the `ufw route allow proto tcp from any to any port 80` part.

Get the id of the `cdn_cdn` network with the `docker network ls` command.

Get the subnet used by the network with the `docker inspect [id]` command. example: 172.24.0.0/16

Run `ufw allow from 172.24.0.0/16`

Ufw will now allow docker communication.
